          <h3>Senior Design: Motion Detector Board</h3>
          <p>
            This board tracks motion with a 9DOF IMU and transmits the processed data via BLE. 
            This design uses 
            an ESP32-C3-Mini-N4 as the microcontroller, 
            an ICM-20948 as the IMU, and two TLV62569DBVT switching regulators.<br><br>
            I wanted to take measurements of a frisbee's motion when thrown. 
            Specifically motion such as the initial RPM, anlge of launch, stability, etc. 
            This can all be done with the on board IMU.<br><br>The IMU has 9 degrees of freedom, a 
            3 axis accelerometer, gyrometer, and magnetometer each measuring in the x, y, and z direction.
             This IMU is important due to its small size and processing power with an on chip data processor.
              This is a prototype that will be reduced in size for the final product.

          <h3>Arduino Voltage Measurement Shield</h3>
          <p>
            This is a custom voltage measurement shield 
            I made for the arduino. This design incorperates 
            four different circuits: a DC-DC voltage doubler, 
            a voltage regulator with an LM317 variable linear 
            regulator, an LM555 timer, and a voltage divider.<br><br>
            I was having a hard time reading the voltage of a laser
             displacement sensor I had that would output a signal 
            of +-10V. The problem is that the arduino 
            analog to digital converters (ADCs) could only read a range 
            of 0-5V.<br><br>This shield will take in the voltage of a 
            9V battery, double it to a range of 16-17V, and the LM317
             voltage regulator will output a percise and consistant 10V.
            This signal would then be added to the laser signal in order to 
            only get possbly 0-20V. Then a simple voltage divider was used
             in order to get the voltage read by the on board ADCs to a 
            comfortable 0-5V range that would be back figured to find the 
            initial voltage on the microcontroller.
