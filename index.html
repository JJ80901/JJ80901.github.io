          <h3>Senior Design: Wireless Motion Board</h3>
          <p>
            This board is designed to capture and wirelessly transmit motion data during a frisbee toss. 
            It features an ESP32-C3-Mini-N4 microcontroller for efficient Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 
            communication and an ICM-42670 high-precision 6DOF IMU for real-time motion tracking.<br><br>
            The primary goal of this project is to analyze key motion parameters of a frisbee throw, 
            including initial spin rate (RPM), launch angle, stability, and acceleration. 
            The ICM-42670 provides high-resolution accelerometer and gyroscope data, which allows for precise 
            measurement of motion dynamics.<br><br>
            This design improves upon previous iterations by optimizing power efficiency and 
            reducing form factor for future iterations. The onboard TLV62569DBVT switching regulator ensures 
            stable power delivery to both the ESP32 and IMU. The compact size and BLE connectivity 
            make this an ideal prototype for real-world frisbee motion analysis, with potential applications 
            in sports analytics, biomechanics research, and performance optimization.

          <h3>Arduino Voltage Measurement Shield</h3>
          <p>
            This is a custom voltage measurement shield 
            I made for the arduino. This design incorperates 
            four different circuits: a DC-DC voltage doubler, 
            a voltage regulator with an LM317 variable linear 
            regulator, an LM555 timer, and a voltage divider.<br><br>
            I was having a hard time reading the voltage of a laser
             displacement sensor I had that would output a signal 
            of +-10V. The problem is that the arduino 
            analog to digital converters (ADCs) could only read a range 
            of 0-5V.<br><br>This shield will take in the voltage of a 
            9V battery, double it to a range of 16-17V, and the LM317
             voltage regulator will output a percise and consistant 10V.
            This signal would then be added to the laser signal in order to 
            only get possbly 0-20V. Then a simple voltage divider was used
             in order to get the voltage read by the on board ADCs to a 
            comfortable 0-5V range that would be back figured to find the 
            initial voltage on the microcontroller.
