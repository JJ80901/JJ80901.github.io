          <h3>Featured Project: Precision Displacement Sensing</h3>
          <p>This board is designed to process and digitize a <strong>±10V analog signal</strong> 
              from a laser displacement sensor, ensuring high-fidelity data acquisition for fatigue testing 
              applications.<br><br>
               The signal enters through a <strong>BNC connector</strong>, passes through 
              <strong>ESD protection and an RF filter</strong>, and is then scaled down to a
              <strong>±1.65V range</strong> using a resistor divider. A <strong>non-inverting summing amplifier</strong> 
              shifts the signal into a <strong>0-3.3V range</strong>, with a <strong>1.65V bias</strong> generated by 
              an <strong>op-amp follower</strong> from a half-resistor divider off the 3.3V power rail.<br><br>
              To prevent aliasing, the conditioned signal passes through a <strong>third-order Butterworth Sallen-Key low-pass 
                filter</strong> with a <strong>5kHz cutoff frequency</strong>, optimized for sampling rates up to 
                <strong>1kHz</strong>. The filtered signal is digitized by an <strong>ADC141S626 14-bit ADC</strong>, 
                which interfaces over <strong>SPI with an STM32F103CBT6 microcontroller</strong>, responsible for managing 
                data acquisition and transmission.<br><br>
                  Power is regulated using a <strong>TLV62569 switching 
                  regulator</strong> for 3.3V conversion and an <strong>HT7533-1 LDO</strong>, ensuring 
                  clean and stable power for the analog front end and microcontroller.<br><br>
                  This design improves 
                  upon earlier iterations by incorporating better filtering, precise voltage scaling, and a 
                  high-resolution ADC, making it ideal for <strong>fatigue analysis, precision displacement 
                    measurement, and other high-accuracy signal acquisition applications</strong>.

          <h3>Senior Design: Wireless Motion Board</h3>
          <p>
            This board is designed to capture and wirelessly transmit motion data during a frisbee toss. 
            It features an <strong>ESP32-C3-Mini-N4</strong> microcontroller for efficient <strong>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 
            communication</strong> and an <strong>ICM-42670</strong> high-precision 6DOF IMU for real-time motion tracking.<br><br>
            The primary goal of this project is to analyze key motion parameters of a frisbee throw, 
            including <strong>initial spin rate (RPM), launch angle, stability, and acceleration</strong>. 
            The <strong>ICM-42670</strong> provides high-resolution <strong>accelerometer and gyroscope data</strong>, which allows for precise 
            measurement of motion dynamics.<br><br>
            This design improves upon previous iterations by optimizing power efficiency and 
            reducing form factor for future iterations. The onboard <strong>TLV62569DBVT</strong> switching regulator ensures 
            stable power delivery to both the ESP32 and IMU. The compact size and BLE connectivity 
            make this an ideal prototype for real-world frisbee motion analysis, with potential applications 
            in sports analytics, biomechanics research, and performance optimization.<br><br>

          <h3>Early Project: Arduino Measurement Shield</h3>
          <p>This was one of my first custom circuit designs, created to solve a 
            real-world problem while working with a <strong>±10V laser displacement sensor</strong>. Since 
            an <strong>Arduino's ADC can only read 0-5V</strong>, I designed this shield to properly 
            shift and scale the sensor's voltage output for accurate measurement.<br><br>
            The design integrates four key circuits: <strong>DC-DC voltage doubler</strong> to boost a 
            9V battery to ~17V, <strong>LM317 voltage regulator</strong> to provide a stable 10V reference, 
            <strong>LM555 timer</strong> for signal conditioning, <strong>Voltage divider</strong> to scale the 
            adjusted signal into the Arduino's 
            readable range<br><br>
            By <strong>offsetting the sensor's ±10V signal to a 0-20V range and 
            then scaling it down to 0-5V</strong>, the microcontroller could accurately determine 
            the original sensor output. This project introduced me to <strong>power regulation, voltage 
            manipulation, and analog signal processing</strong>, forming a strong foundation for my later 
            embedded systems and PCB designs.
